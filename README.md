# Shayari Generator

This repository contains the code for the Shayari Generation web application. The application allows users to generate Shayari. It consists of both frontend and backend components.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Asimji/Shayari_Generator.git
    cd shayari-generation
    ```


2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

    ```
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```


3. Set up environment variables for the backend:

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and provide your OpenAI API key:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    PORT=8000
    ```

    Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

4. Start the frontend development server:

    ```
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

    The frontend will run on `https://ai-content-generation.vercel.app/`.

5. Start the backend server:

    ```
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```


    The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React.js and Chakra UI for the user interface. It communicates with the backend API to generate content based on user-provided keywords.
